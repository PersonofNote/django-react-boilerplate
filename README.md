# Django and React Starter
This repository is to save me some time re-reading documentation, typing commands like "Django startproject projectname," and waiting for Create React App to finish Creating React App.


It is an entirely unopinionated (read: featureless) starter kit for serving a React frontend pulling from a Django backend.
